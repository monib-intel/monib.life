## Knowledge Gaps Identified

### Gap 1: Mobile-Specific Design
While these books cover general principles, mobile-specific patterns and constraints need additional coverage.

**Recommended Reading**:
- "Mobile First" by Luke Wroblewski
- "Designing Mobile Interfaces" by Steven Hoober

### Gap 2: Accessibility
Universal design and accessibility are mentioned but not deeply explored.

**Recommended Reading**:
- "A Web for Everyone" by Sarah Horton
- "Inclusive Design Patterns" by Heydon Pickering

### Gap 3: Design Systems
The books don't address how to scale design decisions across large organizations.

**Recommended Reading**:
- "Design Systems" by Alla Kholmatova
- "Atomic Design" by Brad Frost

### Gap 4: Quantitative Methods
Focus is primarily on qualitative research and principles, less on metrics and analytics.

**Recommended Reading**:
- "Lean Analytics" by Alistair Croll
- "Measuring the User Experience" by Tom Tullis

## Research Recommendations

1. Explore mobile design patterns
2. Study accessibility standards and implementation
3. Investigate design system approaches
4. Learn analytics and measurement techniques
5. Examine contemporary examples and case studies
