## Metadata
- **Title**: The Design of Everyday Things
- **Author**: Don Norman
- **Published**: 1988
- **Category**: Design / Psychology

## Classification & Thesis

### Central Question
How can we design everyday objects that are intuitive and user-friendly?

### Diagnosis
Most everyday objects are poorly designed because designers don't understand human psychology and cognitive principles.

### Thesis
Good design requires understanding human psychology, providing clear affordances, giving immediate feedback, and creating natural mappings between controls and their effects.

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition | Context |
|------|------------|---------|
| Affordance | The perceived action possibilities of an object | Central concept for understanding how users interact with objects |
| Mapping | The relationship between controls and their effects | Critical for intuitive design |
| Feedback | Information returned to the user about what action has been accomplished | Essential for user confidence and understanding |
| Conceptual Model | A mental representation of how something works | Helps users predict outcomes of their actions |

## Structure

### Part 1: The Psychology of Everyday Things
- Chapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things
  - Introduction to design problems
  - Examples of poor design
  
### Part 2: Fundamental Principles
- Chapter 2: The Psychology of Everyday Actions
  - Seven stages of action
  - Gulf of execution and evaluation

- Chapter 3: Knowledge in the Head and in the World
  - Memory and knowledge distribution
  - Design implications

## Argument Architecture

Norman builds his thesis through:
1. Concrete examples of design failures
2. Psychological principles explaining why failures occur
3. Design principles that address the psychological needs
4. Case studies demonstrating successful applications

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Invisible Controls
- Description: Users can't figure out how to operate devices
- Solution: Provide visible affordances and clear signifiers

### Problem 2: Poor Feedback
- Description: Users don't know if their actions succeeded
- Solution: Provide immediate, clear feedback for all actions

## Scope Boundaries

### Domain/Field
Product design, user interface design, human-computer interaction

### Timeframe
Focuses on timeless psychological principles, examples from 1980s

### Intended Audience
Designers, engineers, product developers, anyone interested in usability

### Explicit Exclusions
Does not deeply cover aesthetics or branding, focuses on functionality

## Practical Implications

1. Always consider human psychology in design
2. Make actions visible and discoverable
3. Provide immediate feedback
4. Create natural mappings between controls and effects
5. Design for errors - make them reversible
