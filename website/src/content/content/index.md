# Welcome to monib.life

This is my personal knowledge base, digital garden, and portfolio. All content is maintained in Obsidian. We'll use this as the high-level layer for our knowledge management. The Supernote and handwritten will be better to more focused things, and Obsidian and eMacs or something will be better for further away scope. 

## Core Areas

### [Projects](/projects)
Personal and professional projects showcasing web development, mobile apps, blockchain, and machine learning. Each project includes documentation, technical details, and live demos.

### [Articles](/articles)
Technical writing on web development, software architecture, and engineering practices. Topics include JavaScript, React, cloud infrastructure, and API design.

### [Resume](/resume)
My professional experience, skills, and career trajectory. Maintained as living documentation that evolves with my career.

## About This System

This vault serves as the source of truth for my personal website. Content is written in markdown, managed in Obsidian, and published using [Astro](https://astro.build/).

### Content Workflow
1. **Draft**: AI assistants generate initial content with `status: draft`
2. **Review**: Edit and refine content in Obsidian
3. **Publish**: Remove draft status to publish to website
4. **Evolve**: Continuous updates as ideas develop

### AI Assistants
- **Reading Assistant**: Converts books (EPUB/PDF) to markdown summaries
- **Syntopical Reading Assistant**: Cross-book analysis and synthesis
- **Resume Assistant**: Maintains and updates professional documentation
