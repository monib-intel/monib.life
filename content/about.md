# About This Digital Garden

This is a personal digital garden built with Quartz, designed to share knowledge, ideas, and thoughts in an interconnected way.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a collection of evolving ideas and notes that are interconnected and grow over time. Unlike a traditional blog:

- **Growth Over Time**: Notes are continuously updated and refined
- **Non-Linear**: Content is explored through connections rather than chronologically
- **Work in Progress**: Ideas are shared even when they're not fully formed

## Technology

This site is built using:
- **[Quartz 4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)** - A modern static site generator
- **Obsidian-compatible** - Supports Wiki-links and Markdown
- **TypeScript** - For type-safe configuration
- **SCSS** - For customizable styling

## Navigation

Use the search bar to find specific topics, explore the graph view to discover connections, or browse through the explorer sidebar.
