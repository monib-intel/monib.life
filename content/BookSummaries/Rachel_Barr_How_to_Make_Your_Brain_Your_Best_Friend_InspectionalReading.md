### Chapter 11: Building a Healthy Relationship with Exercise: Movement as Self-Care

**Summary *(from chapter summary)*:** This chapter emphasizes building a healthy, sustainable relationship with exercise by focusing on intrinsic motivation and mental benefits rather than aesthetic goals or extreme fitness standards. The key is to start small, find enjoyable forms of movement, and treat exercise as self-care while respecting your body's needs and avoiding the pitfalls of toxic fitness culture.

**Key Points:**
1. Start with low-intensity activities like brisk walking to enhance brain function and build sustainable movement habits
2. Shift focus from aesthetic goals to how exercise makes you feel stronger and healthier mentally and physically
3. Cultivate intrinsic motivation by viewing movement as self-care and fun rather than punishment or obligation
